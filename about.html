          <p>
            <b>Introduction</b>:
            Team 55 organized and executed a successful Hour of Code event at Sumgait State
            School No 25 on November 6th. This detailed report delves into the specifics of the event, addressing
            various aspects such as the activities conducted, participant engagement, progress, preparation,
            challenges faced, and expressions of gratitude for support.
            <br>
            <b> What Happened During the Hour of Code?</b>
            The Hour of Code at Sumgait State School No 25 was
            designed to introduce third-grade students to the fundamentals of coding in an interactive and
            enjoyable manner. The team commenced the event with an introduction to basic coding concepts,
            explaining algorithms and how programming languages shape the modern world. Following this, the
            participants were exposed to visuals and videos from past Hour of Code events to illustrate the
            excitement and creativity associated with coding activities.
            The main highlight of the event was the hands-on coding experience using the Classic Maze Puzzle.
            This engaging activity allowed students to collaboratively solve coding challenges, fostering
            teamwork and problem-solving skills. The event concluded with a motivational note, encouraging
            students to explore coding further, accompanied by the presentation of certificates to acknowledge
            their participation.
            <br>
            <b>Participant Experience and Progress:</b>
            The participants, consisting of approximately 20 third-grade
            students, engaged enthusiastically throughout the Hour of Code. Given the simplicity and relatability
            of the content, students were able to grasp fundamental coding concepts. The hands-on activity
            further enhanced their understanding, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical
            setting.
